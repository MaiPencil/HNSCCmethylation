# HNSCCmethylation
The intention of this study is to gather data from tcga and cptac databases and cross analyze methylated regions between different subtypes of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). Eventually, once I am able to cluster their subtypes, I will cross analyze with Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma as both cancer types have similarities. Potential biomarkers could be analyzed to help differentiate their subtypes.

## Machine Learning Integration
After cross analysis, I intend to develop a method that will integrate the 'old-school' method of identifying potential biomarkers with a machine learning predictive method. The intention of this is to make discovery of therapeutic targets easier and faster.
