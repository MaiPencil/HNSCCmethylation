## MDS example that shows distance between points instead of variance
## normally uses euclidean strategies in a low dimension scale that highly preserves the original from high dimensional space
## this is based off my methylation data frame

# Compute distance matrix
dist_matrix <- dist(t(met))  # `t(met)` transposes the matrix to have samples as rows

# Perform MDS
mds_results <- cmdscale(dist_matrix, k = 2)  # `k` specifies the number of dimensions (usually 2 for plotting)

# Convert MDS results to a data frame
mds_df <- data.frame(MDS1 = mds_results[,1], MDS2 = mds_results[,2])

# Plot using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mds_df, aes(x = MDS1, y = MDS2)) +
  +     geom_point() +
  +     labs(title = "MDS Plot", x = "Dimension 1", y = "Dimension 2") +
  +     theme_minimal()
